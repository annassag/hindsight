<p>Tenderness</p>

<p>The temptation to look for commonality among a group of graduating students ought to be resisted, not least out of respect for the individual students themselves. They are about to part ways with whatever experience they may have had as a ‘cohort’ (what an awful word that is, with its Roman-military etymology). They will each part in their own way. No need to brand them upon exit.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I cannot help but notice the tenderness in much of the very varied imagery here. Nothing is harsh or calculating; nothing is brash or flashy; nothing is conspicuously knowing or overly keen to impress. For a generation or so, all of those less than tender qualities were what put photographic art of the map. Maybe it had to be smartly calculating and demonstrably so, to assert itself against the prejudices the medium routinely suffers. It had to look tough, like it knew all the angles and references. But something has changed. I think it is to do with tenderness, and I think it’s notable in the works of these particular image-makers. Allison, Angela, D'Angelo, Dawn, Elizabeth, Jane, Morgan, Sean, Robert, and Rory.</p>

<p>Photography escapes definition. If it did not, it would have been consigned to the 19th century like so many other inventions of that era. More than anything, what keeps it open and vital is the world itself (photography’s subject matter) and the subjectivity of photographers. It has been a cruel year or so, for everyone, and for some a lot more than others. Priorities, individual and collective, have been shaken and reset. Subject matter and subjectivities are re-emerging, tentative and fragile. We know a camera can fix and objectify, but in good hands and eyes it can also cradle lightly and offer. It can evoke the tenderness of the world awaiting meaning.</p>

<p>The train ride from New York to New Haven is punctuated by the backs of retailers, like BJ’s and Walmart, and back allies and fire escapes and lawns and cars, both in use and depleted. The current of the speed of the train and all the stops, and the aching in the seat, after two hours, makes the arrival to Cass Gilbert’s designed Union Station a sweet sort of necessary stretch. The tunnels, as you exit, curl out as passengers emerge into a hall epitomized by high hanging sunlight. That light seeps down over everything, including your body—head to toe. If you’re lucky, which I was, there’s a kind ride from two deeply thoughtful strangers that have offered to take you to the exhibition you’re there to see. That’s my story and I’m grateful.
I will not do justice for these students from the graduate class of 2020. I will not do justice for these artists. This is not some coy self-deprecation; I just think it’s a fact given the reality of their tenure. Their works are beautiful, and their lives and stories are deeply thoughtful. They have been shared, in many forms and in many ways already. Their institutional use, to this point, has been dizzying and depleting. Photography is highly adaptive to the technologies and realities that exist to showcase it. But the spirit of these artists’ story is ensnared by the realities of something we all shared but couldn’t understand the way that they do. We didn’t live their experience. As viewers we only get to see it in a past tense. So here I am with letters and sounds to try to provide the one thing, I think, they might appreciate more than anything right now.</p>

<p>Support.</p>

<p>These artists have made pictures that are sewn and snapped, and constructed. They are acted and found and made to mind themselves, their loved ones, those closest to them, and the systems that raised them and the bodies that influence every moment of every day they call their lives. What are their pictures? The answer to that question is clouded by the burgeoning reality that is a barbaric way to learn. A Masters in the fine arts is not something to envy. From this side, it sounds like hell. In its privilege and in its institutional reward it leaves scar tissue. What of the pictures though? I haven’t even arrived at their poetry. I’m still only at the love letter.</p>

<p>But maybe that’s enough.</p>

<p>Dearest D’Angelo, Jane, and Morgan. To my loves Angela, Allison, Elizabeth, Bob, and Rory. To Dawn and to Jiajun, and to anyone who loved you through those two years. I hate that your hindsight is in 2020. The clarity you behold in the pictures you make stir the insides of a world that toppled upside down. You survived, in many ways. You are celebrated in the frames you bestow with your vision and wisdom and everything you learned and will continue to promote as you guide your careers, and your work, into a future that doesn’t ever have to be normal or safe again. You’re worthy of such infinite possibilities and the pictures provide the reward of your generosity.</p>

<p>Telling a story is a radical act of love; it can be. I’m so grateful to be able to share it the way that I see it. I think right now the last thing these pictures need or you need is more academia. So the pictures will live, and you’ll live, and you’ll keep making, or talking, or encouraging others and each other. You’ll grow and find ways to question what you think is in the best interest of the histories that you bring with you. Photography will adapt under the guise of your watchful eyes, and lenses, and apertures, and film, and disk space, and real space, and digital space because they are simultaneous. Together you and these parts will stimulate economies and communities and and and.</p>

<p>And you won’t stop, even should you take on new forms and new ways in which you express things visually, or otherwise. Change is good. The ands will form a skin of legs that will march like ants to hills and towers and other nouns and act like verbs to express what you don’t even know yet exists, but lurks somewhere inside you and drives you to hit that shutter. That shutter is not just the camera, that shutter is you. Like flowing blood and fluids. You will beat…beat…beat. And we will eat, eat, eat up every last visual syllable you put before us. We will view you and see you and let you sink in—so deeply. We will all never be the same in you and through you. It’s already here. It’s happening right now. Thank you for letting us as viewers into the lives you lead.</p>

<p>Please, don’t stop.</p>

<P>—Efrem Zelony-Mindell</P>
